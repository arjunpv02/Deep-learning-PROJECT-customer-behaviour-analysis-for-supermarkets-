 Deep Learning for Customer Behaviour Analysis! 🧠📊

I'm thrilled to introduce my latest deep learning project, focusing on deciphering customer behaviour in retail spaces like supermarkets and hypermarkets. This initiative seeks to uncover valuable insights into product preferences and shopping habits. 🛒✨

In this project, we analyse various data points, including checkout times, time spent in different areas, product checkouts, speech analysis, customer feedback, responses, and foot traffic density. These metrics combine to offer a comprehensive view of customer behaviour. ⏱🗣📈

I’ve enhanced my expertise in libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, XGBoost, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Seaborn, and Plotly. These tools have been instrumental in data analysis and visualisation. 📚🔧

Utilising machine learning models like KNN, Random Forest, and GradientBoostingRegressor has enabled us to build a robust framework for analysing customer preferences and behaviours. 🌐🧩

I’m excited about the potential applications of this project, from optimising store layouts to boosting customer satisfaction. Stay tuned for more updates and insights! 🌟🔮
